# This is the primary entry point to load the Dr. Bash platform.
# While you're free to piecemeal it if you want to save that 75ms
# It is recommended to include this file and get the whole thing,
#   especially while you're still getting used to the platform.
#
# To include this file in your script, copy/paste:
# source ${DRB_LIB:-/usr/local/lib}/drbash.sh
#
# If you have chosen to locate this file elsewhere, then be sure to initialize the DRB_LIB variable in your ~/.bashrc file. 
# Scripts call sudo as necessary, so you should never have to use sudo to call any library function.
#
# Return values:
#   0     Successfully accomplished whatever it was intended to accomplish
#   1-9   General error (catch-all category for an error that doesn't fit any of the other categories)
#   10-19 The user interrupted execution in some way
#   20-29 The operation aborted because the intended result has already been achieved or is logically unnecessary
#   30-39 A dependency could not be resolved or some other necessary resource could not be located
#   90-99 The programmer didn't program correctly
#
# Implementation notes for scripts sourcing this library:
#   1. This is not just a library; it's a scripting platform
#   2. Use the provided script.template file for any new scripts that you write
#   3. Assume that your script will be sourced by downstream tools to extract documentation
#       so have all of your logic in functions 
#       and protect the main method call with IsSourced(), as provided in the template script
#   4. Use the various Log() functions (in logging.sh) for your script's output
#       echo should be strictly avoided in the interest of preseving sanity.
#       Use printf for redirecting output to another command or returning values from functions.
#   5. All Log* functions support stdin via the -- parameter, 
#        so 'echo "message" | Log --' works for all of them.
#
#   Crash course: printf
#   - printf "string"   # copy string to stdout 

# Prevent re-sourcing
